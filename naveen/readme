## Example Usage

To create a new member enrollment, send a POST request to the `/members` endpoint with the necessary member information in the request body.

Using cURL:

  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",

  "birthdate": "1990-01-01"
}' http://localhost:8080/members

    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "birthdate": "1990-01-01"
  }
  

## Assumptions and Additional Details

- The birthdate should be in the format "yyyy-MM-dd."
- Any additional fields in the `Member` entity are assumed to be of type String for simplicity.

Best wishes for your project!
